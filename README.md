# Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising field in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research, offering innovative approaches to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. In this study, we conducted bibliometric analysis combined with topic modeling to provide a comprehensive overview of the AI research landscape in CVD. Our analysis included 23,846 studies from Web of Science and PubMed, capturing the latest advancements and trends in this rapidly evolving field. By employing LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) we identified key research themes, trends, and collaborations within the AI-CVD domain.

The findings revealed the exponential growth of AI-related research in CVD, underscoring its immense potential to revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare. The annual scientific publication of machine learning papers in CVD increases continuously and significantly since 2016, with an overall annual growth rate of 22.8%. Almost half (46.2%) of the growth happened in the last 5 years. USA, China, India, UK and Korea were the top five productive countries in number of publications. UK, Germany and Australia were the most collaborative countries with a multiple country publication (MCP) value of 42.8%, 40.3% and 40.0% respectively. We observed the emergence of twenty-two distinct research topics, including “stroke and robotic rehabilitation therapy,” “robotic-assisted cardiac surgery,” and “cardiac image analysis,” which persisted as major topics throughout the years. Other topics, such as “retinal image analysis and CVD” and “biomarker and wearable signal analyses,” have recently emerged as dominant areas of research in cardiovascular medicine.

Convolutional neural network appears to be the most mentioned algorithm followed by LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours). This indicates that the future direction of AI cardiovascular research is predominantly directing toward neural networks and image analysis.

As AI continues to shape the landscape of CVD research, our study serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI in CVD research. This study offers a deep understanding of research trends and paves the way for future directions to maximiz the potential of AI to effectively combat cardiovascular diseases.
